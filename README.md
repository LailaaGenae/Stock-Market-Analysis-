# Stock-Market-Analysis #
## Objective: create a VBA script that loops through every year & outputs the Ticker, Yearly Change, Percent Change, & Total Stock Volume. 
Using the information above to get the Greatest % Increase & Decrease along with the Greatest Total Volume.

* I started by getting the code to loop through the entire Workbook

* Declared and Defined all of the needed variables

* Assigned Values to all of the variables

* Calculated all changes and percents

* Created columns for all my calculations

* Then applied the conditional formatting based on information recieved.

I used assignments from class & Slack overflow for a broad range of this Stock Market Analysis.
